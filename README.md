## 1. Technical Architecture

XP1 is designed with a **hybrid consensus mechanism**, combining **Proof-of-Work (PoW)** for initial distribution and **Proof-of-Ownership (PoO)** for long-term decentralization.  

**Key features include:**
- AI-enhanced security algorithms  
- Post-quantum cryptographic resistance  
- Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs) for enhanced privacy  
- Optimized block validation reducing orphan rates
